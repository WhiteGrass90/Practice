_**FOR LOOP EXPLAINER**_

for (int i = 0; i<5; i++) { 
int i. This means that in the starting of the loop its value is 0.
    i < 6 - This tells the condition that until i is less than 6, execute/ iterate.
    i++ - This tells that after each iteration, increment the value of i by +1.
    The values would stop at 5 coz its less than 6.
}
